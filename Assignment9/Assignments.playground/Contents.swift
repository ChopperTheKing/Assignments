// what is diff b/w escaping and non escaping

// Closures can be either escaping or non-escaping. Non-escaping closures are closures that are passed as arguments to a function and are called within the same function. Escaping closures are closures that are passed as arguments to a function but are called after the function has completed its execution.

// what is associated values

// Associated values in Swift allow you to store additional custom information along with enum cases. This enables them to hold different types of values associated with their enum cases.

// what is raw values

// Raw values are simple, prepopulated values that you can assign to enum cases. Raw values can be strings, characters, or any of the integer or floating-point number types.

// what is Generics

// Generics in Swift (and many other programming languages) allow you to write flexible, reusable functions and types that can work with different data types while still preserving type safety. It's usually represeented by the letter T, but can be any letter.
