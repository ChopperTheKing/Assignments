// what is app life cycle methods

// The app lifecycle represents the the various phases an iOS app goes through from its launch to termination.

// what is view controller life cycle methods

// The View Controller lifecycle refers to the sequence of events & methods that are automatically called as a view controller goes through different phases, from its initialization to its presentation and dismissal.

// different App States

// an app can exist in various states depending on its interaction with the user, the system, and other apps.

// Diff b/w background and Suspended

// Background:
// The app is in the background, but it's still executing code and performing tasks. It could be updating content, processing data, or handling location updates. Background execution time is limited, and the app can be suspended by the system if resources are constrained.
// Suspended:
// The app is in the background, but it's not actively executing code. It's in a suspended state to conserve system resources. The app can be resumed quickly without a full relaunch.

// Diff b/w try, try? and try!

// The try, try?, and try! keywords are used when working with error handling and throwing functions. They each have a specific purpose and behavior related to how errors are handled and how code execution continues in case an error is thrown.

// different type of inheritance

// Single inheritance: In single inheritance, a subclass inherits from only one superclass. This is the simplest form of inheritance. A subclass can extend the functionality of its superclass while inheriting its properties and methods.
// Multi level inheritance: In multilevel inheritance, a class inherits from a superclass, and another class inherits from the first subclass. This forms a chain or hierarchy of inheritance.
// Multiple inheritance: Multiple inheritance involves a subclass inheriting from more than one superclass. In languages like C++ or some other programming languages, multiple inheritance can lead to complications and the "diamond problem" (ambiguity in method resolution). To mitigate these issues, some languages offer interfaces or protocols to achieve the benefits of multiple inheritance without its complexities.

// why multiple inheritance is not supported

// Multiple inheritance, where a class inherits from more than one superclass, is not supported in some programming languages due to several challenges and complications it introduces.

// diff b/w Struct and classes

// Struct: A struct is a value type. When a struct is assigned to a new variable or passed as a function parameter, a copy of the value is created. Each copy is independent of the others. Structs do not support inheritance. They cannot inherit properties or behavior from other structs.
// Class: A class is a reference type. When a class instance is assigned to a new variable or passed as a function parameter, it's passed as a reference to the same instance in memory. This means that changes made to one reference will be reflected in all references pointing to the same object. Classes support inheritance. They can inherit properties, methods, and initializers from a superclass.
